# Tax Selector

a tax can be thought of as a mandatory investment with -100% return
    maybe the government could allow investment in risky but nationally important startups to count towards tax?
    this could effectively act as a slightly less negative investment, which could allow for more nuanced tax policy

website where you can select government or non-government organizations or projects to donate towards
    your owed tax each year is calculated, and you have to donate at least that much to different projects
    this allows people to decide what to fund, instead of going through a congressional budget
    each org/project states how much funding they'd like for the coming year, and can get up to that much money
    these donations count for 100% tax write-offs
    can allow for additional donations beyond required taxes
    there can be a percentage of the budget determined by congress, and the remainder given by individual choice
    startups trying to develop items of national importance can be listed on here
    this removes a lot of power from lobbyists when it comes to what gets funded
    decouples a lot of economic issues from social issues when it comes to voting for politicians
    can create a prototype and pitch to local or state government
