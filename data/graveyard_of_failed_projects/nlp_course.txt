# NLP Course

I was interested in creating a full NLP course, partly for an ML journal club.

The first course would have demoed some interesting visualizations and manipulations of word vectors.

Quickly realized this would not be worth the time.

# Ideas

write word2vec explanation blog post
    ML is all about representing data as other data
    how to represent words as numbers we can work with?
    can one hot encode everything, but this is obviously a bad idea
    reduce dimensionality by encoding synonyms the same? some information loss
    combine concepts to create new ones
    simple math with projection (dot products), subtraction and addition
    pytorch implementation of automatic training on input books
    show animation of vectors spreading out
    compare training with two types of vectors (u and v) as opposed to just one
    train on recipes to see if I can find relations between ingredients
