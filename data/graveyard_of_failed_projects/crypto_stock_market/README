Crypto Stock Market

This is a stock trading game where you're trying to compete against a mix of bots and real humans.

You trade completely worthless NFTs which are exaggerated knockoffs of the worst crypto-bro projects. Bots are buying and selling these assets to each other, causing dips and peaks in price. Each bot is a real algorithm trading on actual signals, including sentiment analysis on posts in the chatroom. The bots generate posts using language models trained exclusively on r/wallstreetbets. Players can write their own algorithms with an API or use the in-game dashboard to buy and sell NFTs.

Transactions occur via a cryptocurrency called ScamCoin. You get some by joining, but can also buy more from the central bank or another player. You can also cash out at a greatly reduced rate by selling to the central bank. The central bank rates can fluctuate.
