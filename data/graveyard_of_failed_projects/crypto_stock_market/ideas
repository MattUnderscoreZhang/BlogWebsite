stock market MMO
    notes
        crypto and other dubious investment objects as a "wasted money reservoir" that inflate and shrink in relation to the velocity of money in the economy?
        economic game about trying to get the next bubble before it inflates
        everybody buying and selling from each other at once
        fake stock market - could have bots simulating other players at first, to make it really immersive to join
        bots actually do respond to signals, but the algorithms used are completely unknown to the players
        it's also unclear how many bots there are in relation to the players, to make it hard to know how much player actions have an effect
        a chat room with auto generated posts from bots talking to each other, which you have to distinguish from real human posts
        all the assets are worthless auto-generated NFT project knockoffs
        write blog post on Reddit inviting people to come join
        once the player base is large enough, actually have players trade real NFTs (exchangeable for cryptocurrency)
        so these people are betting cryptocurrency on a virtual NFT market, where I make money via a brokerage fee
        let new players have a certain inventory of NFTs for free, and make more packets purchaseable when purchased with crypto
        give players an API so they can write scripts to trade NFTs
    skills
        will need to make a public API, have user accounts, use a crypto blockchain, have an API for buy/sell, and a UI for buy/sell
    before starting
        need to think through how this works in the end, to make sure I'm learning the right things from these projects
