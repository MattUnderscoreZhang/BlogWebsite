# Crypto Stock Market

This is a stock trading game where you're trying to compete against a mix of bots and real humans.

You trade completely worthless NFTs which are exaggerated knockoffs of the worst crypto-bro projects. Bots are buying and selling these assets to each other, causing dips and peaks in price. Each bot is a real algorithm trading on actual signals, including sentiment analysis on posts in the chatroom. The bots generate posts using language models trained exclusively on r/wallstreetbets. Players can write their own algorithms with an API or use the in-game dashboard to buy and sell NFTs.

Transactions occur via a cryptocurrency called ScamCoin. You get some by joining, but can also buy more from the central bank or another player. You can also cash out at a greatly reduced rate by selling to the central bank. The central bank rates can fluctuate.

# Ideas

stock market MMO
    notes
        crypto and other dubious investment objects as a "wasted money reservoir" that inflate and shrink in relation to the velocity of money in the economy?
        economic game about trying to get the next bubble before it inflates
        everybody buying and selling from each other at once
        fake stock market - could have bots simulating other players at first, to make it really immersive to join
        bots actually do respond to signals, but the algorithms used are completely unknown to the players
        it's also unclear how many bots there are in relation to the players, to make it hard to know how much player actions have an effect
        a chat room with auto generated posts from bots talking to each other, which you have to distinguish from real human posts
        all the assets are worthless auto-generated NFT project knockoffs
        write blog post on Reddit inviting people to come join
        once the player base is large enough, actually have players trade real NFTs (exchangeable for cryptocurrency)
        so these people are betting cryptocurrency on a virtual NFT market, where I make money via a brokerage fee
        let new players have a certain inventory of NFTs for free, and make more packets purchaseable when purchased with crypto
        give players an API so they can write scripts to trade NFTs
    skills
        will need to make a public API, have user accounts, use a crypto blockchain, have an API for buy/sell, and a UI for buy/sell
    before starting
        need to think through how this works in the end, to make sure I'm learning the right things from these projects

# Prep Projects

bot verbal spouting (text bot training and deployment)
    have two chatbots, one trained exclusively off of r/chad_vs_virigin comments, and one off of lolcats
    make them talk to each other in real time when you push a button
