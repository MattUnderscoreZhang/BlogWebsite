# Spoken Phrase Recognizer

I was thinking of making a spoken phrase recognition training tool.

The idea is that you could upload a few samples of you speaking, along with credentials for some compute environment. I would then train the net for you, and you can either download the weights to use yourself or use my webapp API and let me host the phrase recognition app for a fee.

May still come back and revive this project later. Just have other things to focus on right now.

# Ideas

spoken phrase recognizer
    can train and download trained model, or keep trained model on my cloud and access via API for a fee
    pre-research
        "https://betterprogramming.pub/building-an-alexa-or-siri-equivalent-bot-in-python-ea07ed001445"
    part 1 - voice transcription
        take voice input and save in textbox as text
    part 2 - AI conversation
        use OAuth2 to have someone log on to their GPT-3 account via my webpage
        send transcribed voice text and send to GPT-3
        have GPT-3 responses be read (can generate speech using tortoise-tts)
    part 3+ - text blogpost(s) about how to do training
        look up how to train audio recognizer
        speech_clips repo to cut up generated speech from tortoise-tts
        create an RNN that trains to recognize a single recorded phrase - generate tons of spoken text for training
    part 4 - python app to upload a few recordings of a phrase and generate a passphrase recognizer
        make training run on client's computer
        log on to user's AWS account to run training (or Lambda account, or Snowflake? Google? add more)
        first 100 uses are free, then 1 penny for each call after
        note that this is too slow for anyone to actually want to use this (first have to finish recording, send, then get back)
        download link to Python repo for common use case demos (upload recording, record by holding down spacebar, record with microphone button that times out where you have to click submit)
        can add repos for other languages in the future if people use this
