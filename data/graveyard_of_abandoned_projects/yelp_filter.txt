# Yelp Filter

I was playing around with the Yelp API and with some mapping functionality, and created a simple webapp to show only cheap restaurants nearby with ratings above 4 stars.

This didn't turn out to be interesting enough to publish, but I might come back later and add more functionality.

Repo made private for now at https://github.com/MattUnderscoreZhang/Geofunctions.

create a road trip planner
    add data from Atlas Obscura, TripAdvisor, national park and monument registries, Yelp, etc. to find stuff of interest along route
