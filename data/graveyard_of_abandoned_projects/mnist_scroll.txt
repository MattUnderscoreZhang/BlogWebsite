# MNIST Scroll

Basically wanted to have a nice way to scroll through my website. Imagine if the section headers were MNIST digits that morphed (e.g. 1 -> 2) as you scrolled down the page, with some accompanying background color effects.

MNIST scroll to morph
    have digits shift in size, orientation, and color between scrolls
    use for interactive website as a section selector on the main page
